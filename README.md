# CryptoTran

I did the first three parts of the assignment due to the limited time-frame and the wish to complete it as fast as possible.
I wished to do a simple front-end in React but had no time left for that. However, if you are interested to see some simple 
React front-end I worked on recently, you can check my URLShorster project.
### Time estimations (the numbers correspond to those of the tasks in the assignment file):
1. Estimation - 30 mins, Final time spent - 1 hour (I discovered a way to define constraints when writing the schema for the
mongodb database and tried it out)
2. Estimation - 3 hours, Final time spent - 4 hours (Node.js is not my main framework so there always is an adjustment period
until I can enter my regualr flow)
3. Estimation - 1 hours, Final time spent - 1,5 hours (Same reason as above plus I've never worked with worker threads before)
### Assumptions and Final Notes:
I did not use any blockchain library for transactions, amounts, currencies, everything is virtual.
The project might need some more validations for the transaction processing part, and also more validation and input sanitization.
There might be some inconsistencies in the code due to my limited experience with Node.js and Javascript, anyhow I tried to do my 
best considering the time I was able to invest.
